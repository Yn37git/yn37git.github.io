It is 25 km from Gubbi, and 36 km from taluk headquarter Gubbi, and 43 km from Tumkur headquarter, it lies in western part of Tumkur and is at a distance of 121 km from Bangalore. Sira, Madhugiri, Tumkur city and Nelmangla are nearby cities to Manchaldore. Manchaldore has a total area of 273.9 hectares, irrigated land is about 47.7 hectares, non-irrigated land is about 20.32 hectares, about 5 hectares of water covered lake in central part.</p> <h2 id="land">Land</h2> <hr/> <p>There is both dry as well as wet land in Manchaldore, and land here is fertile. And is well used for agriculture. There is small forest in the south west part of Manchaldore some wild varieties of guava can be found here. 2 hill tops or small mountains can be found: Madhaga between Manchaldore and Muchalanahalli and Khrishna kal gudda between Manchaldore and Nallur. Now because of scarcity of water and less rain the land has lost its fertility here.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/2-480.webp 480w,https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/2-800.webp 800w,https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/2-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="manchaladore" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> map view of Manchaladore </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/3-480.webp 480w,https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/3-800.webp 800w,https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/3-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/3.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="manchaladore" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Topological view </div> <h2 id="history">History</h2> <hr/> <p>People in this village say that in Manchaldore several centuries ago when people just dug slightly on the surface water would emerge from the soil so people called the place: “Manh-Chala-Thore” meaning ‘water comes out as dug on mud or surface’ and as people pronounced this fast it became Manchaladore. Some people also say that a local king called “Manchala” ruled this place so it was called Manchaladore meaning the place ruled by Manchala. There are many forts like structures located in the hilly areas of Manchaldore, people here say that there were kings who fought the war here during the british rule. some dead bodies were also found in some wells, which confirms this fact. Manchaldore is a village headquarters for 12 nearby villages about inside the 3 kms radius. Recently one of the oldest Temple of Narasimhaswamy was renovated. The Idol was in the form of long stone or udbhava Moorthy, and has a name of Kambada Narasimhaswamy i.e., Narsimha from the pillar, this temple was in bad condition so in year 2000 all villagers of 12 village gathered and formed a committee to renovate and improve the temple. With the help of government of India, the temple is now renovated.

Groundnut, Chilli, Coconut, Areca nut, Betel nut, Corn, Mango, Cucumber, Channa dal, tamarind are also grown here seasonally. Pottery is Product Manufactured in this village. Total irrigated area in this village is 47.76 hectares from canals 47.76 hectares is the Source of irrigation. The use of sprinklers, drip irrigation is followed in farms. Borewells, wells, and nearby lake is the source of water for farmers here. There are two lakes in the village one in central part named Matad kere another in north-eastern part named Huli kere which is dried up and is filled partially when there is heavy rain. Farmers sell their produce to Tumukur mandi and some farmers sell their produce to local merchants. Because of lack of rain in last few years the yield the farmers get here are decreasing and most farmers are opting crops that require less water to grow. There are no dams or water reservoirs near the village nor there are any rivers passing by so most of farmers rely on borewells and other artificial sources of water. Farmers buy most of the required seeds for growing or harvesting from the government’s agricultural committees located in Tumkur and Chellur. Farmers here are using subsidy facilities of sprinklers and other equipment’s given to them by the government. Most farmers store their harvested crops or produce in or near their houses.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/4-480.webp 480w,https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/4-800.webp 800w,https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/4-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/4.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="manchaladore" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Farmer </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/5-480.webp 480w,https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/5-800.webp 800w,https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/5-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/5.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="manchaladore" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Farmland (areca nut trees) </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/6-480.webp 480w,https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/6-800.webp 800w,https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/6-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/6.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="manchaladore" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Farmer </div> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/7-480.webp 480w,https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/7-800.webp 800w,https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/7-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="https://yn37git.github.io/assets/img/manchaladore/7.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" title="manchaladore" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> farmland </div> <h2 id="administration-and-politics">Administration and politics</h2> <hr/> <p>Village has is panchayat office located in front, its Gram panchayat, Mandal panchayat is governed by local leaders and the secretory appointed by the revenue department of India handles the panchayats working, taluk panchayat comes under Gubbi, headquarter of taluk panchayat is located in Gubbi city.<br/> Polling booth is located in government school of Manchaldore.
