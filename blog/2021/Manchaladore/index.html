Some people also say that a local king called “Manchala” ruled this place so it was called Manchaladore meaning the place ruled by Manchala. There are many forts like structures located in the hilly areas of Manchaldore, people here say that there were kings who fought the war here during the british rule. some dead bodies were also found in some wells, which confirms this fact. Manchaldore is a village headquarters for 12 nearby villages about inside the 3 kms radius. Recently one of the oldest Temple of Narasimhaswamy was renovated. The Idol was in the form of long stone or udbhava Moorthy, and has a name of Kambada Narasimhaswamy i.e., Narsimha from the pillar, this temple was in bad condition so in year 2000 all villagers of 12 village gathered and formed a committee to renovate and improve the temple. With the help of government of India, the temple is now renovated.
