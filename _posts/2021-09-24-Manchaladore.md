## History
---
People in this village say that in Manchaldore several centuries ago when people just dug slightly on the surface water would emerge from the soil so people called the place: 
“Manh-Chala-Thore” meaning ‘water comes out as dug on mud or surface’ and as people pronounced this fast it became Manchaladore.
Some people also say that a local king called “Manchala” ruled this place so it was called Manchaladore meaning the place ruled by Manchala.
There are many forts like structures located in the hilly areas of Manchaldore, people here say that there were kings who fought the war here during the british rule. some dead bodies were also found in some wells, which confirms this fact.
Manchaldore is a village headquarters for 12 nearby villages about inside the 3 kms radius. Recently one of the oldest Temple of Narasimhaswamy was renovated. The Idol was in the form of long stone or udbhava Moorthy, and has a name of Kambada Narasimhaswamy i.e., Narsimha from the pillar, this temple was in bad condition so in year 2000 all villagers of 12 village gathered and formed a committee to renovate and improve the temple. With the help of government of India, the temple is now renovated.

## Problems faced by people and other expectations by the people
---
- As the ground water is also depleting in the village people here are asking for water to be channelled from nearby Hemavati river and to refill and develop the two ponds in the village.    
- There is a huge problem related to water a there is low rain fall in this region
- People also say that road have to be remade as there is potholes and breakdowns etc
- There are no public toilets in or near by the village 
- There are no ATMs or any bank branch in or near the village 
- There is no ambulance facilities service running near the village and also if people face major problems the have to travel at least 10kms to find a proper hospital
- There are also no nearby fire stations
- As there are migration, people of the village fear of lack of development in the future
