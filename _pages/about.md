Hi! I have completed my masters in mathematics and am currently looking for a PhD. role. I am interested in Number theory, Linear algebra, Machine learning and Algebra (These may seem like vast and different topics but as I am just begining my Journey , I am ready for a good exploration).

Currently I am preparing for competitive exams and interviews for a PhD. role. Feel free to contact me.
