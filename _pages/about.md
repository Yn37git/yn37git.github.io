Hi! 

I am currently a first year PhD student in the [School of Mathematics](https://maths.iisertvm.ac.in/) at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Thiruvanathapuram ([IISER TVM](https://www.iisertvm.ac.in/)). I am interested in Partial Differential Equations, Applied and Computational Mathematics.


I have completed MSc. Mathematics from M.S. Ramaiah University of Applied Sciences ([MSRUAS](https://www.msruas.ac.in/)) and BSc. (PCM) from St. Josephs College ([SJC](https://sjc.ac.in/)).

I usually sit in a quite dark room and study or overthink, apart from that I play chess, like to teach, like to debate, and am interested in [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) and Digital freedom movements. Fell free to contact me, I'm happy to have a good chat. 

also here's my :
